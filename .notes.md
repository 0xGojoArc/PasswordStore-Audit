# Notes
- Owner sets the password and only owner can retrieve it, others are not.
- Owner is the one who is owner of the contract (`msg.sender`).



# Attack vectors
1. Missing Access Control
    - in file PasswordStore.sol, function storePassword , there is no check for owner before storing the password, so any account can store the password
